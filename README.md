INTRODUCTION
------------

The movielens dataset from movielens.org contains 27,753,444 ratings and 1,108,997 tag applications across 58,098 movies. These data were created by 283,228 users between January 09, 1995 and September 26, 2018. Our objective is to use PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark, to conduct an analysis of the dataset, allow for user input to interact with the data, and use a recommendation engine to provide user and content-based recommendations.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This project requires setting up Apache Spark for the distributed computing and using PySpark, the python API, to manipulate the dataset. I use Jupyter Notebook to access PySpark and import relevant libraries such as ipywidgets for widgets, plotly and seaborn for visualizations, pandas for data manipulation, and SKLearn and Fuzzy Wuzzy for the recommendation engine. These can be installed using pip.
